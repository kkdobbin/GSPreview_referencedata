# GSPreview_referencedata
Data and scripts for compiling reference data from various sources as part  of GSP review project April/May 2020. Reference data includes data on number of domestic wells and public water systems per GSA/GSP etc. 

# What is where
Data folder has faw CSV outputs from spatial joins (done in Q)

Scripts folder has R script used to compile all but one of the data files in the data folder into a master summary data table

Finaldata has the output of the data compilation script and a reduced version of the raw domestic well summary data which could not easily be joined with the other data due to slightly differing GSA names. This final join was done by hand in preparing individual data tables for GSPs
