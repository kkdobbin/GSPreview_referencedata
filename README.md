# GSPreview_referencedata
Data and scripts for reference data used in GSP review project April/May 2020

#What is where
Data folder has faw CSV outputs from spatial joins
Scripts folder has R script used to compile all but one of the data files in the data folder into a master summary data table
Finaldata has the output of the data compilation script and a reduced version of the raw domestic well summary data which could not easily be joined with the other data due to slightly differing GSA names. This final join was done by hand in preparing individual data tables for GSPs
